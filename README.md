## Hi, I'm Coela

I develop hardware and software for open-source projects, mainly focusing on embedded development, systems administration, and task automation.

- I’m currently working on a rewrite of my 3D rendering engine Prototracer, refactored into a native/embedded backend called uCore3D.
- Ask me about vector math, physics, or quaternions.
- How to reach me: <a>coelacannot&#64;gmail&#46;com</a>
- Pronouns: Feel free to ask me!
